## Greenage Residents

Residents entering Greenage by cab/auto/walk must show their myGate profile on the phone at the time of entry. If you prefer, you can just provide your unique 6-digit myGate entry code instead. Security will verify your registration with Greenage using this code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your profile picture in myGate app is mandatory. If no picture is uploaded, you will be requested to show a government ID to match the name on your myGate profile.

 If you do not have a smartphone, anyone in your family living in the same flat could create the 6-digit code for you, or visit the GOA office with a Photo ID and they will create one.  

Residents entering in their personal vehicles with stickers will not be stopped. Residents entering in vehicles without stickers will need to show their myGate profile or quote the 6 digit security code. 

> [!Tip]
> For faster entry, residents entering Greenage in cabs or autos can pre-approve their entry in myGate.
> When adding a profile picture, you can upload an existing picture from your gallery or use the phone camera to take a picture in real time and upload.
