In the past, there were many instances of water leakages and other incidents from the unoccupied flats, when the residents were away for a long period. This has led to damage to their own flat,  neighbouring flats and also the common areas. 

Please take the following precautions, before you leave the apartment unattended for many days.

1. Inform the facility to get the gas valve closed by the gas mechanic

2. If you can reach the master valve in the kitchen pipeline duct that supplies water to kitchen,try and close that. If there is no access to the master valve, then 
	- Close the inlet valve to the water purifier
	- Close the washing machine/ dishwasher inlet valve
	- Ensure all teh other taps in the kitchen are closed

3. There is a master valve in each bathroom. This valve is accessible if the false ceiling is opened in the shower area. This valve in each bath room should be closed.

4. Close the tap that supplies water to the flush tank in each bathroom. (This is a different water source)

5. Switch off the main power in MCB/RCCB near the front door

6. If you have an extended balcony, please close the taps in that area and also ensure no obstruction to the free water flow through the drain trap

> [!Tip]
> It is preferable to give one set of keys to friends or neighbours well known to you - this will help facilities to attend to the issue in case of emergency.
