# Extended Balconies

> Important guidelines for flats with extended balconies

If you are one of the flats with extended balconies in Greenage, you are expected to follow the below guidelines to ensure the safety and aesthetics of common areas are not compromised.

1. No permanent structures or alterations to the existing structure are permitted. A temporary structure or frame with acrylic/ plastic roof is permitted. Usage of bricks or roof tiles is prohibited. 
2. Rainwater drainage channels are to be installed on all the temporary shades so that the dirty water does not flow on to the walls of the building. Alternatively, the roof can end 6 inches inside your own terrace.
3. Epoxy coating is to be done on the tile joints. Water seepage from the terrace is damaging the reception area of many blocks or causing inconvenience to the apartments below. If not done recently, please do get epoxy coating done immediately. This point applies to other flat owners with balconies having severe leakages. 
4. Plants must not be kept on the walls of the parapet or hanging on the roof over the wall. Please keep the walls free from any objects that can fall and cause damage to human lives and property. This point applies to all the flat owners and must be complied with forthwith.

Considering the severity of the impact to the common areas, the estate manager or facilities team will visit the flats periodically to ensure the below guidelines are being followed. Please extend your support.
 
This is an interdependent community and as with all multi-storeyed apartments, ensuring that we do not cause inconvenience or damage to a neighbor or any resident is our prime duty.
 
Please ensure that we work together to make Greenage a happy and safe place to live in.
