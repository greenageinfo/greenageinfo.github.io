# Greenage Library is Bustling

We started digitizing the library in 2022. Despite the incomplete categorization and tags, there are 4,000+ books in the General category and almost 1,500 in the children category. Of course, the library is one of the most loved places by the “Children of Greenage.”

Over __1,700__ books were checked out of the library in 2022, __1,453__ in 2023, and over __1,200__ books so far (as of Jul 31) in 2024. The single highest checked out by a person was 98 books. That kid will definitely cross 100 pretty soon. The active number of members checking out and circulating books has consistently stayed above 100 at any given period.

Some of the most popular Children’s books are;

- Percy Jackson and the Greek Heroes
- Percy Jackson and the Greek Gods
- Diary of a Wimpy Kid 09
- Diary of a Wimpy Kid 10. Old School
- Diary of a Wimpy Kid - The Third Wheel
