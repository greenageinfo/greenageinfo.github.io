# Waste Segregation

Waste segregation at source is mandatory by law for the apartments of our size. All the flats must follow the below guidelines for segregation, to comply with BBMP guidelines.

> Housekeeping staff will not pick up waste from the flats that do not segregate waste. As per BBMP rules for bulk generators, failure to segregate waste will attract a penalty of ₹500 for the first instance and subsequently ₹1,000 per instance.

## Wet Waste, Reject Waste and Dry Waste

- Picked up at doorstep between 9.30AM - 12.30PM. Any Waste placed outside after 9.30AM will not picked up. In such cases, Residents must take the waste inside and not leave it out. 
- All bins must be marked with your flat number. The bins must be kept next to the doorstep on the left, right or opposite of the front door of the apartment, while taking care to ensure the walkways are not blocked. Do not keep them in the main hallway opposite the lifts. 
- Residents are expected to take the empty bins inside immediately after the pick-up and not leave the bins in the common areas.

## Debris waste

- Picked up from doorstep between 9.30AM - 12.30PM, where feasible. For large items, residents must dispose them in the garbage collection area in each block or contact housekeeping staff. All interior / renovation waste must be disposed in the garbage collection area in each block and not be left in the lobby areas. 

## e-Waste

- Two e-waste collection bins are placed next to the facility office in Birch block. Please dispose the negative value items such as bulbs, batteries etc. in one of the bins. All the other e-Waste material will go into the second bin.
