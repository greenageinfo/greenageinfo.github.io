# Greenage

The official community website for Salarpuria Sattva Greenage, Bangalore (INDIA).

› [Greenage.Life](https://greenage.life)

The contents here are plain-text as much as possible for durability and easy portation to any platform that can chew on raw text files and spit out HTML. We will stay as simple, minimalistic, and raw as possible. Whatever we try to add or use, let's make sure it has no extra bells and whistles.

## How to Write

Do not include any plaform specific snippets, like, Jekyll's `{{ site.baseurl }}`. Write in plain [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (a better way to write plain-text).

## Development
