# Tenant Lease Agreements
For all the single-tenant and multi-tenant apartments,  it is mandatory that GOA office has the rental agreements with valid dates. This is to improve safety & security in Greenage and to minimize owner-tenant disputes. 

## Existing Tenants
Please go to the Settings section in myGate App (click on the profile picture on the top right of the home page). Household Manage > Documents > Add Document > Flat > fill-in the validity dates as per the agreement and upload the document.

## New Tenants
At the time of move-in, you can send the scanned rental agreement document to the GOA office to have it uploaded for your flat. 

## What will be considered a Valid Rental Agreement

The lease agreement must be signed by both parties and need to be on a stamp paper. It must have valid dates and expired contracts from previous years are not accepted. Please upload the full document with signature pages. In case of a multi-tenant flat, every tenant of the flat must have a valid rental agreement. 
Without a valid rental agreement, the apartment may be deemed unoccupied in myGate
