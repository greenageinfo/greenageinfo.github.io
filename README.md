# Greenage

The official community website for Salarpuria Sattva Greenage, Bangalore (INDIA).

â€º [Greenage.Life](https://greenage.life)

The contents here are plain-text as much as possible for durability and easy portation to any platform that can chew on raw text files and spit out HTML. We will stay as simple, minimalistic, and raw as possible. Whatever we try to add or use, let's make sure it has no extra bells and whistles.

## How to Write

Do not include any plaform specific snippets, like, Jekyll's `{{ site.baseurl }}`. Write in plain [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (a better way to write plain-text).

## Development

The current version is powered by [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev). Install the necessary modules to be able to run VitePress. Here is a quick reference for the simplest way to develop locally.

### Command

- Run locally: `npm run docs:dev`
- Build: `npm run docs:build`
- Preview the build: `npm run docs:preview`

### Plugins

Install the needed plugins with `npm i -D plugin-name` and follow their usage instructions.
