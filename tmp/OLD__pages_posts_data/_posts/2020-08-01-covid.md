##### <a name="symptoms"></a>Home Isolation procedure for residents having COVID like symptoms

1. If any resident  is having COVID like symptoms, he/she should self declare the condition to GOA and also immediately call Karnataka Helpline numbers. 

2. All visitors including daily helps and personal drivers must be avoided

3. The resident shall immediately arrange for COVID test to be done preferably at home 

4. The resident and their family must self isolate at home until the results are negative.



##### <a name="positive"></a>Home Isolation procedure for residents tested COVID positive

1. Please e-mail GOA Health and/or inform your Block GOA member that you are CoVID positive. You will need to join a  Covid care group on Whatsapp to provide better support. Also, please fill in <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/Greenage-COVID-contact-tracing-form"> fill-in the contact tracing form</a>  to identify the primary contacts.

2. The flat where a resident is tested positive will be treated as a “containment zone”. All residents in the flat should be in Home Isolation for a mandatory period of 7 days from the day of report.  

3. If the resident is being shifted to a designated COVID treatment hospital, GOA will provide the needed support during the Ambulance pick-up. The lifts and the floor of the affected apartment, will be sanitized after the resident leaves for hospital and also back to flat. 

4. If not tested earlier, other residents in the flat are recommended to get themselves tested, preferably at home. However, even if they test negative, they shall continue with 7-day home isolation. If the resident who tested positive is hospitalized and other residents have tested negative, still all residents in the flat maintain 7-day home isolation. 

5. Contact tracing will be done to identify all people who have come in contact with the resident tested positive, in the last one week. All primary contacts and their families in Greenage, need to self isolate. The primary contacts must get tested as per the guidelines from the government. They should also inform the secondary contacts who they had come in contact with. Any resident opting for Covid tests must be self-isolated at home until the results are available.

6. Daily helps and personal drivers employed by the flat in ‘containment zone” will be blocked in MyGate and will be asked not to enter the premises until the home isolation period ends

7. Groceries and essential items can be delivered to the door. Residents shall not open the door to collect the delivered items, but wait until the delivery person notifies the flat that he/she has left the containment zone. 

8. All the waste generated from the containment zone will be treated as bio medical waste. The cleaning and waste collection by the housekeeping staff will happen between 2PM and 4PM everyday. 

9. Only emergency maintenance complaints like gas leaks will be handled with adequate precautions. 

10. The 'containment zone' will be removed post the mandatory 7 day home isolation period (or as per BBMP guidelines). Resident(s) who  tested positive are advised to self-monitor health at home for an additional period of 7 days. They are recommended to stay indoors until self monitoring period is complete. 

11. Maid/ house help can be allowed after 7 days of home isolation period, if they tested negative in the last 7 days and no resident in the flat has any symptoms or tested positive.
