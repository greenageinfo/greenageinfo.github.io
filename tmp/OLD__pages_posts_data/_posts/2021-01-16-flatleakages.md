There are many unresolved issues related to seepages between the units in Greenage. This policy is to provide clarity on resolution of such issues, while minimizing the disputes.


As per our resident code of conduct and the prevailing laws, a leakage between the units must be addressed by the owner/resident of the flat where the problem originated. The owner/resident of such a flat must extend full cooperation to the affected neighbour and the association committee for undertaking the repairs. 

**Where fair and appropriate, the cost of repairs shall be borne by the owner/resident of the flat where the issue has originated.**


1. When a leakage has been observed by the occupier of the affected flat, they must first do a proper due diligence and then approach the owner/resident of the flat where the issue may have originated along with supporting photographs and request to have the issue resolved. 

2. The owner/resident of the flat who received such a request must take up the repairs to arrest the leakages within 2 weeks. In the event of significant leakage (e.g. flooding of the apartment below) the issue must be addressed immediately. 

3. In the event of delay or denial from the owner/resident of the flat, the occupier of the affected flat can approach the facility manager with a written complaint. 

4. The facility team will engage an external vendor to investigate and report to the owners/residents. 

5. Responsibility and cost of repairs will be decided as follows:

    * Issue is completely from the flat on which the complaint was raised (100% of the cost of repair to arrest the leakages be borne by the flat where the problem originated)

    * Issue need to be jointly addressed by both flats (Cost shared by both flats)

    * Issue is related to common structural/plumbing problems impacting multiple flats (Facility to resolve the issue)


The report by the facility team will be the final word on this topic. In case of non cooperation, GOA, having the overall responsibility to maintain structural integrity of the buildings, will have to apply punitive measures to the uncooperative flats to resolve the issue.
